1. Once you have the repository, you can create folders and files in the local repostory folder and then you can stage (add) to the repository.
      git add file_name.extension 
      
2. To add all files in the current directory
      git add .
      
3. To see the current status of the repository, run the following
      git status
      
4. We now commit changes. That means the current state of the files/folders will be stored in the git repository permanently.
      git commit -m "type a message to name the changes"
      
5. Once the changes are committed it can be pushed to the server repository
      git push origin main
